# Quick Setup
1. The raw folder is stored in this GitHub.
2. The `data` folder currently only contains the `raw` folder. You need to **create directory** for the **DB**. The new directory should have this path: `<path_to_server_dir>/data/db`.
3. Use PyCharm!! This handles a lot of Pythonpath issues much easier.
4. In order to use the classifiers, you will have to perform data preprocessing again **for each subject**.

# Knowledge Requirements
This project actually made use of many different frameworks and technologies. The README and Wiki pages cannot be expected to explain every single step how to use these frameworks and technologies.

Here is the list of technologies used:
1. Tornado Web Server
2. MongoDB
3. Android OS
4. Tizen OS (with WebSocket)
5. AngularJS (with WebSocket)
6. ngrok (tunnelling)

# Important Note
This quick setup note is **NOT** complete! Please read my FYP report and the Wiki pages in this repository. The FYP report focuses on the ideas from the high level perspective while the Wiki pages give more technical details.
