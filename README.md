# Final Year Project: Human Activity Recognition System
This repository contains all the code related to my Final Year Project which is about recognizing human activities using Smartphone and Smartwatch. Raw data collected can be found in this repository as well.

An important contribution is the exploration on how using **mean deducted sensory data** can **significantly** improve the testing results, especially the Leave-One-Person-Out (LOPO) testing. To my own knowledge, there **has not been** any other work using a similar technique to a Human Activity Recognition problem.

# Steps to Reproduce My Work
`README` files are provided only for the `client` and `server` folders as only these two involve non-trivial setups. There is no guide for the Smartphone and Smartwatch as it can be found easily from the internet.

I suggest anyone who are interested in using the code to read the code one by one and understand the logic flow. I have given my best effort to write the `README` files, but writing very detailed step-by-step documents are too time consuming and I do not think it is necessary. Reading the code should be the best way to understand everything.

# Raw Data
Please contact me through this GitHub account if you would like to get the full raw data I have collected. I removed it from this repository because it is too big to download and it is harder to maintain the GitHub repo due to large file limitation imposed by GitHub.
