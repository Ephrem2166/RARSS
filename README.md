# Final Year Project: Human Activity Recognition System
This repository contains all the code related to my Final Year Project which is about recognizing human activities using Smartphone and Smartwatch. Raw data collected can be found in this repository as well.

# Steps to Reproduce My Work
`README` files are provided only for the `client` and `server` folders as only these two involve non-trivial setups. There is no guide for the Smartphone and Smartwatch as it can be found easily from the internet.

I suggest anyone who are interested in using the code to read the code one by one and understand the logic flow. I have given my best effort to write the `README` files, but writing very detailed step-by-step documents are too time consuming and I do not think it is necessary. Reading the code should be the best way to understand everything.
