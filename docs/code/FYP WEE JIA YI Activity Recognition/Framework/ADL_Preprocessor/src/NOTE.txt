The android application will generate a stream of Accelerometer and Barometer data:
1. Each data row will contain the Start Time, End Time, sensor reading, and ACTIVITY TAG (an integer code mapped to the activity name)
2. The preprocessor will need 2 files:
    - The original raw data CSV file (the stream of sensor readings)
    - The Activity Tag CSV file
        - This file can be created MANUALLY by looking at the raw data CSV file
        - For each activity data stream (those data rows with the same activity tag code put sequentially):
            - Take the Start Time and End Time (NOT THE READING START AND END TIME, BUT ACTUALLY THE START AND END OF THE WHOLE ACTIVITY!!)
            - Note down the activity tag code

        - Basically, this Activity Tag CSV file is kind of a summary of the RAW DATA STREAM FILE


3. The preprocessor will loop through EACH OF THE ACTIVITY TAG FILE rows:
    - For each of them, take all Accelerometer reading for THAT ACTIVITY TAG
    - This is done by looping through the RAW DATA FILE line by line and adding that RAW DATA to the current ACTIVITY TAG RAW DATA LIST

4. Conduct data sampling at a fixed frequency:
    - Loop through the raw data for that activity tag
    - If there are multiple raw data points in one interval, only use the last data point
    - Calculate the accelerometer magnitude
    - Once sampling is done for one interval, add that to the PROCESSED INPUT array
    - Each Activity Tag HAS ONE PROCESSED INPUT ARRAY!!
        - This is because the file does not contain the class name information (it's in the file name only)
